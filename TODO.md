# TODO - Portfolio Design Enhancement

1. Enhance CSS (assets/css/style.css)
   - Add hover effects on project cards, skill badges, buttons, and social icons.
   - Implement fade-in and slide-up animations for sections on scroll (container loading animation).
   - Add pulse effect animation for buttons.
   - Add typing animation styles for hero intro text.
   - Improve color usage and transitions for better visual appeal.

2. Update JavaScript (assets/js/main.js)
   - Add typing animation script for hero text cycling through intro lines.
   - Implement scroll event listener to trigger fade-in and slide-up animations on section visibility.
   
3. Minor HTML updates (portfolio_site/index.html)
   - Add any necessary classes or attributes for animations and interaction as needed.

4. Testing & Validation
   - Test on different screen sizes for responsiveness.
   - Test hover effects and animations for smoothness and interaction.
   - Make sure Bootstrap components remain functional.

5. Deliver final enhanced portfolio design.
